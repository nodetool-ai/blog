# About NodeTool

NodeTool is a local-first visual environment for building and running AI workflows. It empowers developers and creators to build sophisticated AI applications through an intuitive node-based interface.

## What is NodeTool?

NodeTool transforms AI development by providing a visual programming environment where you can:

- **Build AI Workflows Visually**: Create complex AI pipelines using an intuitive drag-and-drop node editor
- **Run Locally**: Your data and models stay on your machine - privacy by design
- **Multi-Model Support**: Integrate with OpenAI, Anthropic, Replicate, ComfyUI, and more
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Token-by-token LLM streaming and progressive image generation
- **Extensible Architecture**: Build custom nodes and extend functionality
- **Deploy Anywhere**: Run workflows on your local machine, server, or cloud

## Key Features

### Visual Node Editor
Build AI workflows using a powerful node-based interface inspired by tools like ComfyUI and Blender. Connect nodes to create pipelines for text generation, image processing, audio synthesis, and more.

### Actor-Based Streaming Architecture
NodeTool uses an innovative actor-based execution model that enables:
- Real-time token streaming from LLMs
- Progressive image generation with intermediate results
- Concurrent node execution without blocking
- Built-in backpressure management

### Privacy-First Design
- All processing happens locally on your machine
- No data sent to external servers (unless you explicitly use cloud APIs)
- Full control over your AI models and data

### Rich Node Library
- LLM nodes for text generation and chat
- Image generation and manipulation
- Audio processing and synthesis
- Video processing capabilities
- Data transformation and utilities
- Custom node support
